# arduinoSnake

Classic snake game. The goal of the game's development is to exceed the 
program storage and memory of the Arduino uno board by implementing new features. 
After that, I want to analyze the code for areas of improvement.

## Possible future features
- Starting screen whit game options
- Game levels
- Alternative game modes (whit walls and whitout)
- Saving leaderboard to sd-card
