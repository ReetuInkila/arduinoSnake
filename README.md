# arduinoSnake
This project represents my current c++ programming level very well

Classic snake game. Long term goal of the game's development is to exceed the 
program storage and memory of the Arduino uno board by implementing new features. 
After that, I want to analyze the code for areas of improvement.

## Possible future features
- Starting screen whit game options
- Game pausing
- Game levels :white_check_mark:
- Alternative game modes (whit walls and whitout)
- Saving leaderboard to sd-card 
- Tests
